# HackScheme

## About 
>> I started this project as a fork of JScheme (http://norvig.com/jscheme.html). JScheme is literally the first scheme compiler/interpreter I have ever used
and while using it, it was also my first time coding in scheme. I loved it.
>>  Since I'm a great java developer it didn't even take time for me to grasp the source
code of the interpreter.
